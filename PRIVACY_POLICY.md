# Privacy Policy for Until

**Effective Date: February 15, 2026**

Until ("the App") is a context-aware reminder application for iOS developed by IbnuJabir ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information the App accesses, how it is used, and your rights regarding that information.

## 1. Data Collection and Storage

Until is designed with privacy as a core principle. All data created and used by the App is stored locally on your device in a SQLite database. We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data on external servers. There is no server-side component, no cloud syncing, and no remote database.

The types of data the App stores locally include:

- Reminders you create (text, dates, times, locations, and associated conditions)
- Voice-to-text transcriptions generated from your spoken input
- App usage preferences and settings
- Geofence configurations for location-based reminders

None of this data ever leaves your device.

## 2. Permissions and Their Purpose

The App requests the following device permissions, each of which serves a specific function within the App. You may grant or deny any of these permissions through your device settings at any time.

### Notifications

The App uses local notifications to deliver reminders at the times and conditions you specify. These notifications are generated entirely on your device. No push notification server or external service is involved.

### Location Services

The App uses Location Services to enable location-based (geofence) reminders. When you create a reminder tied to a specific location, the App monitors your proximity to that location so it can alert you at the right time. Location data is processed on-device and is never transmitted to any external service.

### Microphone

The App requests microphone access to allow you to create reminders using your voice. Audio input is used solely for the purpose of converting your speech into text for reminder creation. Audio recordings are not stored, saved, or transmitted.

### Speech Recognition

The App uses on-device speech recognition to convert your spoken words into text when creating voice reminders. This processing occurs locally on your device. No audio or transcription data is sent to external servers.

### Screen Time (DeviceActivity)

The App uses the Screen Time API (DeviceActivity framework) to detect when specific apps are opened on your device. This enables context-aware reminders that can be triggered by your app usage patterns. Screen Time data is accessed only for this purpose, is processed on-device, and is never collected or shared.

## 3. Third-Party Services

The App does not integrate any third-party SDKs, analytics tools, advertising frameworks, or tracking technologies. No data is shared with third parties for any purpose.

## 4. Analytics and Tracking

The App does not perform any analytics, telemetry, or user tracking. We do not collect usage statistics, crash reports, or behavioral data.

## 5. Advertising

The App does not display advertisements and does not integrate with any advertising networks.

## 6. Data Retention

All data created by the App remains on your device for as long as you choose to keep it. You can delete individual reminders within the App at any time. Uninstalling the App will remove all associated data from your device, including the local SQLite database and all stored reminders.

We do not retain any copy of your data because we never have access to it in the first place.

## 7. Data Security

Because all data remains on your device, the security of your information is governed by your device's own security mechanisms, including device passcode, Face ID, Touch ID, and iOS data protection. We recommend keeping your device software up to date and using a strong passcode to protect your data.

## 8. Children's Privacy

The App is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Since the App does not collect or transmit any personal data, there is no mechanism through which such data could be gathered. If you believe a child under 13 is using the App in a way that raises concerns, please contact us at the address below.

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in a revised version of this document, and the "Effective Date" at the top will be updated accordingly. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically. Continued use of the App after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.

## 10. Your Rights

You have full control over all data stored by the App. You can:

- Delete any reminder or data within the App at any time
- Revoke any permission (location, microphone, speech recognition, notifications, Screen Time) through your iOS device settings at any time
- Uninstall the App to remove all associated data from your device
